/*! \mainpage Wolf-Gang Engine

The Wolf-Gang Engine is a 2D, RPG-styled engine for creating extremely interactive scenes. The goal is to encourage expressiveness in storytelling and the flexibility to do things as you please.

This flexibility also means that this engine will not be simple. You have to understand how the things work before it becomes easy.

These documents were made very quickly and might be lacking in some areas. If there is anything that needs elaborating, please say so.
